20. On the corner of the Oude Vest Molenstraat, turn left.

At this angle you can see across a grand monument from the
history of Breda: the monastery barracks. It is a part of the former
St. Catharinadal convent that was located here since 1295. The
present building dates from 1504. In 1645, the Norbetine sisters 
were expelled from Breda to Oosterhout.
