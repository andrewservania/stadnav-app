5. You immerse yourself immediately in the early history of Breda if
you take the path to your right, crossing the small bridge which leads you
further through the Valkenberg park.

The park was used as castle backyard for the Lords of Breda.
The park gets its name from a falcon house, which was located near the park and from which the
castle residents and their guests did falconry practice.

The park was originally a real forest with high trees.
In the seventeenth century its forest attributes disappeared
when French style garden was being constructed.

A replica of the 17 images is further into the park in a special landscaped shrubbery.
This is a shrubbery memory of the French-style garden.
The original image can be viewed in the Museum of Breda.

In 1995 Valkenberg park got a new look.

Throughout the park, paths were shifted, shrubs and bushes were removed
and new lighting was installed.
Aside of all this, new park benches were placed along with playgrounds for children.

Excavations revealed remains of foundations of a medieval tower wall
and the stone wall that surrounded "small Breda" in 1537.

Two wall towers were reconstruction upon later on.
