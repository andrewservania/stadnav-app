17. Diagonally across the Grand Place is the town hall of Breda
and also the dependence of the Tourist Office.

The main entrance to the state house is located above the platform, which is monitored
by two sandstone lions. The town hall, as it is now, was established in
in 1767. There were actually four houses. The
architect of Orange, William Philips Schonck, was hidden behind a façade. 
The oldest part is the great hall. Already in the fifteenth century,
the hall was also known as a 'Cleyn Raedthuys' in use. In 1898 came
the rightmost house, the 'Landscape Hert', which is still a separate
façade.

Despite the fact that the town hall is only open for limited
audience, we have the following information on the inner side.
Lady Justice above the main entrance and the wooden statue back of the hall
indicates that in the town hall it was used to practise law.
The desk of the former court, even the back wall of the
hall is now preserved in the Breda Museum .
At the left side there's a large copy of the famous painting of Velasques' Las
Lanzas ", the photo portrays the surrender of Breda to the Spanish commander Spinola  in 1625.

The original painting hangs in the Prado in Madrid.
The town hall is still used for public councils and the
contract of marriages. The mayor, aldermen and municapality officials
are situated since February 1992 in the new city office at Claudius
Prinsenlaan in Breda. 

By the gatehouse to the right of the hall we walk towards
the Stadserf. In the middle of this square the statue serves as
a reminder of the Turfschipper of Gerarda Rueb, the legendary raid in 1590 of
Adriaan van Bergen with his Turfschip. (The Tourist Breda sells this a
replica).
