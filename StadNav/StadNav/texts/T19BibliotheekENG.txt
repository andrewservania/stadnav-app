19. At the end of the St. Jansstraat turn right into the Molenstraat.

In Molenstraat, on your right you will see the Library, designed by architect
Herman Hertzberger. Because Molenstraat is quite narrow, the architect
created space by sloping the walls of the library (on the corner of the Oude Vest) where it formerly
was a gate. Above the gate stood the Lord's Caught Huys, where the
most prisoners were housed. The place still indicates pebbles in the
asphalt and it is the site of the old moat.
